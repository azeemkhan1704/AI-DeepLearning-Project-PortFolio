# AI and Deep Learning Project Portfolio  
Welcome to my project portfolio! Here, I showcase projects that demonstrate my expertise in deep learning, computer vision, NLP, and AI. Each project is hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces** for interactive access.  

## Projects  

### 1. Brain Tumor Classification  
- **Description**: A deep learning model combining GANs and DDPMs for brain tumor detection using MRI images. Achieved high accuracy and implemented explainable AI (Grad-CAM).  
- **Link to App**: [Brain Tumor App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/azeemkhan417/BrainTumor)  
- **Technologies**: GANs, Diffusion Models, CNN, Grad-CAM  

### 2. Eye Disease Classification  
- **Description**: A VGG-19-based model to classify eye diseases using retinal images, optimized with transfer learning and cross-validation.  
- **Link to App**: [Eye Disease Classifier](https://eyediseaseclassifier.streamlit.app/)  
- **Technologies**: VGG-19, CNN, Data Augmentation, Streamlit  

### 3. Sentiment Analysis with Word2Vec and TF-IDF  
- **Description**: An NLP project that analyzes text sentiment using Word2Vec embeddings and TF-IDF vectorization.
